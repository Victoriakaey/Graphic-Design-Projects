I did this for my cats, Kitty and Bangbang! 
Function:

1. You can move the cat's head, tail, leg, and feet by dragging the corresponding bar. 
2. You can also turn off the animation of each part by turning the switch off.
3. You can move the camera by modifying the camera angle by dragging the bar.
